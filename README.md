## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
## Tools used
# 1.
Node.js and npm: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side. npm (Node Package Manager) is a tool that comes with Node.js and is used to install, manage, and share packages (libraries) written in JavaScript.

# 2.
Create React App: Create React App is a popular tool that sets up a new React project with a predefined directory structure, build scripts and development server. It helps you quickly start building React applications without the need for manual configuration.

# 3.
React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and manage the state of your application efficiently.

# 4.
React Hooks: In this example, we used the useState hook, which is a feature introduced in React 16.8. Hooks allow you to use state and other React features in functional components without needing to write class components.

# 5.
CSS: We used Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to style the components and create a visually appealing user interface for the calculator app.

# 6.
JavaScript: JavaScript is the programming language used to write the logic and behavior of the calculator app. We used JavaScript to handle button clicks, perform calculations, and manage the state of the application.

# 7.
HTML and JSX: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files. This is how you define the structure of your components in React.

These tools and technologies worked together to create a functional and interactive React calculator app. The combination of Node.js, npm, Create React App, React itself, React Hooks, CSS, and JavaScript allowed us to build a dynamic user interface with calculated results based on user interactions.
